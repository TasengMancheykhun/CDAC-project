## Optimization of Scientific Numerical Code using Parallel Programming

* This project aims to optimize the performance of a sequential program by utilizing parallel programming techniques such as MPI, openMP and GPU programming using CUDA. The performance of each parallel programming technique will be evaluated and compared.

### The sequential code
* The sequential C code implements a quantum system's time propagation using numerical methods, specifically designed for a discrete quantum system in a potential well. It employs matrix operations, eigenvalue solving, and time evolution algorithms commonly used in quantum mechanics simulations.

* The code simulates the time evolution of a quantum state in a harmonic potential, based on a given initial state and a specified time-dependent interaction. The primary goal is to compute the dipole moment of the system over time.

* The key components in the code are:
